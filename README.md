## #My goal as Level Designer
- Create 5 levels where the difficulty and challenges change using only and all the actors provided by the game designer.
## #Game Design, in short
### #layer goal: Recover all the eggs present in the levels
### #Rules: Must not be seen by enemies in the level
### #Player Enemies:
- Large spider, rotates 90 degrees every x seconds
- Small spider, runs forward
- ![RC](/HighresScreenshot00027.png)
- While Large spiders are in the game from the beginning, Small spiders spawn and despawn in "Red Holes"
  
### #Mechanics:
- If the player is seen even once and for a second, he goes back to the starting point and has to start over. The player knows the size of the "Enemies Kill area" by the red lights
- To continue through the levels, you must first go to the "trade points" (indicated by green mushrooms). In doing so, he will receive earth to bridge the gap between one level and the next.

- In level 2 the real challenge is represented by the "Darkenss" debuff which makes the view less
- Bomb: Player hits it and after x seconds it explodes, killing enemies in the last stage. This item is inserted only at the end to do something "fresh" to the player.

### #Layers and Other Actors:
The levels become increasingly difficult and complex, so that the player has time to learn step by step how the game works.
- Level 0: Introduction to the player's purpose
- Level 1: Introduction to the first opponents
- Level 2: The player understood how enemies work, the difficulty increases thanks to the " Darkness " debuff
- Level 3: The level is completely new, it's not difficult but still challenging
- Level 4: Same as level 1, but with much more enemies
- Level 5: Mix of everything learned, The player now has the ability to kill opponents
